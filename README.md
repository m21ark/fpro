This is a `Python` clone of the classic [Flappy Bird](https://flappybird.io/) game, built using `Pygame` and `PyQt5`.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay

The goal is to avoid obstacles and survive as long as possible.

Controls:

- SPACE or UP ARROW ‚Üí Jump
- RIGHT ARROW ‚Üí Glide

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You can only glide up to 5 times per game.

## üé® Customizations

This version introduces a collectible skin system:

- Skins can be purchased in the in-game store using coins collected during gameplay.
- At the start of each new game, randomly chosen owned skins are applied.

You can access a store to buy new skins with coins earned through gameplay. The shop adds a layer of customization and progression to the game, making each playthrough unique.
